# Agent Project Requirements

## Overview
A chat and voice-based AI agent powered by Dia (open source framework) that can interact with users through text and speech, with sentiment analysis capabilities to adapt its responses based on user emotion.

## Core Requirements

1. **User Interface**
   - Implement a simple chat interface for text-based interactions
   - Add voice input/output capabilities
   - Design a minimal, clean UI that shows agent status (listening, processing, responding)

2. **AI Capabilities**
   - Integrate Dia as the core conversational AI framework
   - Enable natural language understanding for parsing user queries
   - Implement context retention to maintain conversation flow
   - Add knowledge retrieval capabilities for answering user questions

3. **Voice Processing**
   - Implement speech-to-text for user voice input
   - Implement text-to-speech for agent voice responses
   - Ensure low latency in voice processing for natural conversation flow

4. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Integrate sentiment analysis to detect user emotion from text and voice
   - Implement response adaptation based on detected sentiment (friendly for positive, empathetic for negative, etc.)
   - Create different response templates/tones based on sentiment categories

5. **Testing & Development**
   - Create test scripts with sample conversations and expected responses
   - Implement logging for all interactions to analyze performance
   - Build a simple dashboard to visualize conversation metrics and sentiment trends

## Technical Specifications

1. **Framework**
   - Use Dia as the core AI framework
   - Consider additional libraries for sentiment analysis (e.g., NLTK, spaCy)
   - Select appropriate speech processing libraries

2. **Deployment**
   - Initial deployment for local testing on desktop/laptop
   - Ensure minimal system requirements for testing
   - Document setup process for future expansion

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response time: <2 seconds for text, <3 seconds for voice
   - Sentiment analysis accuracy: >80%
   - Conversation context retention: At least 10 exchanges

## Future Enhancements (Post-Testing)
   - Multi-platform deployment
   - Enhanced sentiment analysis with more nuanced emotion detection
   - Integration with external APIs for expanded capabilities
   - Voice customization options
   - Personalization based on user preferences and history

## Cursor Usage Instructions

1. **Setup in Cursor**
   - Copy these requirements and paste them into a new file in Cursor
   - Save the file as `agent_project_requirements.md`
   - Use Cursor's autocomplete features to expand on specific sections as needed

2. **Development Workflow**
   - Create separate files for each major component (UI, AI, voice, sentiment)
   - Use Cursor's AI-assisted coding to help implement complex functions
   - Leverage Cursor's code explanation features when integrating libraries

3. **Testing in Cursor**
   - Create test files with Cursor's assistance
   - Use Cursor's debugging features to identify and resolve issues
   - Document test results directly in the project files

4. **Collaboration**
   - Share the requirements file with collaborators
   - Use Cursor's version control integration if working with others
   - Add comments to explain specific implementation decisions

5. **Implementation Tips**
   - Implement one component at a time, starting with the basic chat interface
   - Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
   - Use Cursor's code suggestions to optimize performance
